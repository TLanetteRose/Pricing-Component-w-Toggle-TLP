## My Challenge

My challenge was to build out this pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I needed a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this challenge. 

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard

There was a  **Bonus** Part of the Challenge: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS. I did try to code the toggle switch functionality using CSS. However, I decided to use JavaScript.

Learn about using **before** and **after** pseudocodes to place labels to the sides of the toggle switch.

Wanted to try to use CSS for toggle functionality. It was easier with JS and using an addEventListener. Instead of using onclick in HTML
